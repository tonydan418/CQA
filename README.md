# CQA Random Forest code folder
This Github folder explores Random Forest Forecast on Stocks with Equal-weighted, Liquidity-weighted, and momentum weighted portfolio performance

1. original.ipynb contains the simple random forest code scheme with a simple equal-weight portfolio backtesting 

2. CQA_momentum_weighted.ipynb contains random forest scheme with the inclusion of momentum-adjusted portfolio weight.

3. CQA_liquidity_weighted.ipynb contains random forest scheme with the inclusion of liquidity-adjusted portfolio weight code scheme.

4. CQA_liqudity_then_return_weighted.ipynb contains random forest scheme with a first inclusion of liqudity-adjusted on weights, along with a filter scheme based on returns as second.
